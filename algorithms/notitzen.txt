CohMetrix

Works, but applied on whole Dataset it makes little sense, So i must give the 
Model the option to apply subsets of the dataset to the CohMetrix Algorithm

ComputerAssistedClustering 

Works, but could use a functionality that allows for automatic number of 
clusters detection using an elbow curve functionality
