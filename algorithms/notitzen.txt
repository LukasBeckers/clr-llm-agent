!!! Change everything to Tomotopy !!! It works best

!!! Check Parameters for all Algorithms

!!! Make Prompt or a prompt explanation part of the classes 

!!! Set all seeds to 42

!!! add a _visualize method to each algorithm

!!! maybe find optimal number of topics via coherence

CohMetrix

# Check Parameters!!!

Works, but applied on whole Dataset it makes little sense, So i must give the 
Model the option to apply subsets of the dataset to the CohMetrix Algorithm

ComputerAssistedClustering 
Works, but could use a functionality that allows for automatic number of 
clusters detection using an elbow curve functionality


CorrelatedTopicModeling 
works but the parameters need to be changed
